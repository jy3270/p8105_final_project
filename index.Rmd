# Content of Our Project
We use the data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021?resource=download&select=world-happiness-report.csv), trying to explore the relationship between the happiness ladder score and other social factors.

In the exploratory analysis part, we:

- Summaries the basic statistics over variables.
- Visually analyse the happiness ladder score and other metrics over different region.

We also perform statistical analysis including:

- Statistical test comparing mean ladder score over regions, pre/post covid, difference in social factors and distribution of ladder score over happy/unhappy region
- Regression analysis selecting the optimal subset of social factors that help us understand their relationship with happiness ladder score.
- Principle Component Analysis 

For our reader to freely explore our data and try to understand our model, we provide a interactive shiny app for people to:

- Try how different values effect the ladder score
- Compare user selected variables over different country/region
- Check association between each pair of factors.
